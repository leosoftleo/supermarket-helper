# Supermarket Helper

## Introduction
First React project ✌🏻 

This project aims to design and implement a simple supermarket utility. The functions include product table 📝 and cart 🛒. In order to make all the things more straightforward, the UI render and business logic may mix together in a single file. Avoid over-engineering in a simple project 🔧.

## Demo
### Product Table
The user can select the categories to filter the products.

The product table also provides sorting functions.


### Cart
The user can add the new item to the cart by using drag and drop. The cart icon will show the number of products.

The cart page shows the product information. The user can remove a single item or the whole list.
